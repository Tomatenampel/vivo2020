We are pleased to announce the free workshops for VIVO Conference 2018.  Workshops will be approximately three hours each and cover topics such as VIVO development, data integration, working with stakeholders, and complementary projects and technologies.

##### VIVO Product Evolution: Exploring New Technologies

Alex Viggio, Paul Albert, Richard Outten

*Keywords: technology, VIVO code, ontology, data, user experience*

The VIVO code base has grown over 15 years to more than half a million lines of Enterprise Java code. Experience has shown a steep learning curve for new developers especially front end developers, and difficulty in integrating newer web development technologies and approaches. Is there an opportunity to experiment with new technologies and techniques that are easier for new developers to dive into? The VIVO Product Evolution group is leading an effort to turn this opportunity into a reality. The vision is to prototype an agile web/mobile application that showcases the researchers, units, and scholarly works of an institution with their branding. 

This workshop will be a working session for the VIVO Product Evolution group, but also an occasion to engage with other interested VIVO community members. The workshop will include updates and discussion involving the group leadership and current subgroups, lightning talks exploring new technologies and methods, and breakout sessions for the subgroups. 

The current subgroups: 
* Representing VIVO Data 
* Functional requirements 
* Implementing the presentation layer 

Technologies, standards, and approaches under evaluation: 
* JSON and JSON-LD 
* SOLR and ElasticSearch 
* GraphQL 
* Schema.org as well as other scholarly information and data models (CERIF, CASRAI, COAR, CD2H) 
* Javascript Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc) 
* Modern Agile principles
