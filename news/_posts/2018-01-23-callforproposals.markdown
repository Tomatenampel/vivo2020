The Ninth Annual VIVO Conference will be held June 6th through 8th at the JB Duke Hotel in Durham NC. The VIVO Conference creates a unique opportunity for people from around the world to come together to explore ways to use semantic technologies and linked open data to promote scholarly collaboration and research discovery.

The VIVO conference is an excellent opportunity to meet with VIVO team members from participating institutions. The conference offers an open and collaborative environment to share ideas and discuss topics related to adoption and implementation of VIVO, VIVO-based tools and the opportunities created by advancing data sharing and team science.

Our theme this year is “The value of making scholarly data open, found, and consumed.” Therefore:

* If you are an implementer, technologist, librarian or data scientist working in the VIVO space, we want to hear from you!
* If you use a product supported by the VIVO ontology such as VIVO, Profiles RNS, Clarivate Analytics, or Elsevier Pure and you have a story to tell, we want to hear from you!
* If you are involved in other aspects of disseminating open scholarly data or the semantic scholarly web, we want to hear from you!

**Proposals must be received by Sunday, March 18th, 2018 at 12:00 AM EST.**

All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:

##### Conference Presentations and Panels

Proposals for presentations or panels should be maximum of 500 words. Abstracts of accepted presentations and panels will be made available through the conference’s website. In general, sessions will have two or three presentations; panels may take an entire session or may be combined with a presentation. Relevant proposals unsuccessful in the main track will be considered for inclusion, as appropriate, as a poster.

##### Posters and Demos

We invite proposals for posters and demos that showcase current work. Proposals for posters and demos should be maximum of 500 words. Attendees will view and discuss your work during the poster/demo reception. Demos will be held during the poster session. The person presenting the demo should provide the equipment (typically a laptop). Please indicate in your submission whether you are proposing a poster or a demo.

##### Workshops

Proposals for the free workshops should also be maximum of 500 words. Workshops will be held on June 6th and each will be 3.5 hours long or the whole day. We encourage proposals that focus on trending topics relevant to the VIVO community as well as the the broader semantic web community, research information systems, evaluation and impact, transparency in scholarship, open science and open data principles. Please address the following in your workshop proposal:

* Length of session (e.g. half a day or a whole day)
* Learning outcomes from the session
* How many speakers you plan to invite
* How many attendees you plan to accommodate
* Audio, visual and facility requirements

##### Please note:

The VIVO 2018 Conference Task Force welcomes proposals that are still in the formative stages, and may work with potential presenters to focus their proposals further. Proposals should name any particular products or services that are integral to the content of the presentation. However proposals should not be used as a venue to promote any product, service, or institution.
