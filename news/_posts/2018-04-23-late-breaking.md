#### Late Breaking Call For Posters

If you missed the earlier deadline, you have until May 30 to [submit your poster abstract](https://easychair.org/cfp/VIVO2018).  The poster reception will be held on Thursday evening. There are many benefits to presenting at the VIVO poster session, but here are four good reasons:

##### 1. Present in a stress-free situation.

The poster session at VIVO conferences is always informal and laid-back. You'll talk to just a few people at once. If presenting to a group doesn't sound fun, the poster session is a great way to get experience without the pressure.

##### 2. Road-test your big idea.

Get instant feedback from fellow attendees about your current work. It doesn't need to be polished or complete. This is your chance to bounce your idea off VIVO community members.

##### 3. Meet potential collaborators or consumers of your work.  

Chances are, others are trying to solve the same problem and you could give them the solution they need. Or you might get help with a sticking point in your own work.

##### 4. Contribute to the scholarly ecosystem.

Deposit your poster in figshare to generate a citation for your work and add it to the 2018 conference page in OpenVIVO.
