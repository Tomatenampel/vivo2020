  title: "VIVO in the euroCRIS Directory of Research Information Systems (DRIS): a growing presence, multiple use cases"
  description: "Taking the under-construction euroCRIS DRIS as a starting point, the session will feature an introductory presentation by a euroCRIS representative exploring the geographic distribution and the various configurations for the VIVO implementations listed in the directory. A number of case study presentations will follow featuring the two main settings for VIVO systems in Europe: as standalone Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) and as research portals on top of an underlying 'monolithic' CRIS. A round table with the presenters will close the session in which various VIVO configuration issues will be discussed.
 
The planned structure for the session is as follows:
<ul>
<li>\"VIVO in the euroCRIS Directory of Research Information Systems (DRIS)\" (Pablo de Castro, euroCRIS Secretary)
<li>VIVO case studies in the euroCRIS DRIS: an overview
<ul>
<li>\"VIVO as a standalone CRIS\" (Sonja Schulze, Universität Osnabrück)
<li>\"VIVO as a front-end for an underlying 'monolithic' CRIS (I): the case of University of Milan\" (Unimi presenter TBC)
<li>\"VIVO as a front-end for an underlying 'monolithic' CRIS (II): the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) approach by SIGMA Research\" (Anna Guillaumet, SIGMA AIE)
</ul>
<li>Round table on the various ways to use VIVO to showcase the institutional research information
</ul>"

  title: "Web of Science Workshop"
  description: "The Web of Science (WoS) is a trusted source for publication and citation metadata of 
  scholarly works dating back to 1900. The multidisciplinary database covers all areas of science, as 
  well as social sciences, and the arts and humanities. WoS is comprised of works published in over 20,000 
  journals, as well as books and conferences. The Web of Science RESTful API makes the trusted WoS dataset 
  easily available for analytics or reuse. In this introductory seminar, we will present the WoS APIs, the 
  metadata available, and API registration process. Example API use cases will be walked through using a 
  provided Postman API client Collection, and freely available Python code for loading WoS data into VIVO 
  will be demonstrated."
