Do you help make scholarly data open, found, and consumed?
Do you have fresh ideas or new work you want to share with us?
Weâ€™d love to hear from you!
The VIVO conference covers a broad range of topics
surrounding research information systems.
With VIVO 2019,
we are widening the scope of talks
to target a broader audience of people working in this space.
