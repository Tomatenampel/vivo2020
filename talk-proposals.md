#### Present your work and ideas at VIVO 2019

Do you help make scholarly data open, found, and consumed?
Do you have fresh ideas or new work you want to share with us?
Weâ€™d love to hear from you!
The VIVO conference covers a broad range of topics
surrounding research information systems.
With VIVO 2019,
we are widening the scope of talks
to target a broader audience of people working in this space.

3. Keep an eye on the interactions, and reply when meaningful.
4. **between 15 April and 15 May:**

   they will become visible immediately
